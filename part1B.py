# (b) The measure of uncertainty is determined by its entropy. Entropy should be com-
# puted as
# X
# H= (âˆ’pi log pi )
# where pi is the probability of event i. If we consider the occurrence of alphabets in
# English as events of interest, determine the entropy. In other words, determine the
# uncertainty of alphabets in the English language using fileB.
